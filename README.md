# React Native Post-Graduation Project

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, created as part of a post-graduation program.

The project is bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native. Run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
